        <p>Maenan, the prince of Rongod, son of the king, Menon is the current defender of the precious stone.</p>

        <p>Many Rongodians, the people of Rongod thinks that even though he lacks the sheer size of Skeletony, he would still defeat him in a 1v1 fight.</p>
        <p>Some even think that Maenan is the fulfiller of the ancient prophecy which tell that one day the sons of Skeletony will arrive in Rongod and do everything in their power to steal the precious stone.</p>
        </p>
        <p>Some even think that Skeletony himself will attack the kingdom in the west and even though Rongod has a massive army and giant walls, they know that no one except the fulfiller of the prophecy can defeat him.</p>
        <p>Rongod is the only city of the western lands, the malgirions which is the home, the only home to the humans in the world of Nuresia</p>
        <p>The city's walls are what stands out the most and it does not lack any history. Tales tell that the walls were made from the very first king, Maonenon. He was a great and respected king, but also the one that started the fight with Skeletony and the skeletons.</p>
        <p>Maonenon apparently woke up the giant skeleton from an eternal sleep by screaming so loud that even the trees in the far east shivered.</p>
