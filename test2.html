        <p>The precious stone is the most valuable and most sought after item in the entire universe, excavated from the deep mines of Rongod in the beginning of time.</p>
        <p>The prince of Rongod, Maenan is one of a very long line of royalty that have witnessed its true power however nobody except them know anything about it.</p>
        <p>Some are very sceptic about the precious stone's actual existence. Some mean that it is all just a fluke, a filthy lie to hide all of Rongod's real problems!</p>
        <p>There are even protesters, or as Maenan calls them: Stone-deniers. They are doing everything in their power to expose the royalty about the filthy lie that they belive the precious stone is!</p>
        <p>Skeletony has always been aware of the precious stones existence but he was not capable to recruit an army... until now.</p>
