        <p>The great and feared Skeletony is the king of the dark and powerful force in the east, the skeletons.</p>

        <p>He is feared by many, especially by the kingdom in the west, Rongod. His fiercest enemy is the beloved prince of Rongod, Maenan.</p>

        <p>Tales tell that Skeletony stand at a staggering 25 ft 8 inches tall and even though he lacks flesh, blood and intestants he weighs 4000lbs.</p>
        <p>The weapon of his choice is the same as the skeletons which goes by the name of: The sons of Skeletony, however the giant sword that lies in his hands weighs as much as 200 of the swords that the skeletons bear.</p>
        </p>
        <p>Skeletony has an army of 20000 loyal, hard-fighting skeletons who are ready to risk their lives for Skeletonys glory.</p>
        <p>No Rongodian know exactly where Skeletony live but some think that he sleeps and lives on a bed of fallen skeletons, in the far east, where darkness is always present.</p>
        <p>Skeletony has no idendity and no desire, except capturing the precious stone. Some say that he is created by the darkness.</p>
